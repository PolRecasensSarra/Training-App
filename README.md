# ImproveMe
Hello, my name is Pol Recasens Sarr√†, student of Video Game Design and Development at CITM (UPC), Terrassa. 
ImproveMe is my final degree project. I have created this application for rehabilitation companies, so that they can better monitor their patients.
It is currently not available on Google Play as it is still being developed.

Thanks to this application, rehabilitation companies or personal trainers can create personalized routines for their patients and better monitor them.
