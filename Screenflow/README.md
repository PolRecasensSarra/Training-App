# Screenflow

This is a prototype for the Screenflow of the application. It has no UI distribution, since this is just to understand and have in mind how many screens are in the app and the navigation between these.

There are three types of Users: Worker, Client and Individual.
In the Login Page you will choose which user you are and will do the requested registration. Depending on which type of user you are, you will be redirected to it's respective Home Page once you are logged in. 

The next step is to design the User Interface. This UI will be placed on the different screens that have been created in this phase.
